# Hi, I'm Ishan 👋

I'm a 4th Year Software Engineering student interested in AI and building cool tech.

### 🔭 Currently Working on:
- **AI Course Planner** – Developing an AI agent to help UVic students plan their courses based on their major and completed credits.
- **DevLoft** - Developing a web app which can be used by SWEs for real time collaborative coding.

Feel free to poke around any of the repos I got! 🙃
